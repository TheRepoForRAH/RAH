# RAH!

Welcome to our repository. Here's what we have for you:

1. **Agent Prompts**: Detailed prompts for each agent in our assistant.
2. **Implementations**: The complete code for agents and the overall assistant.
3. **Interactive Demo**: A Jupyter notebook titled `try_assistant.ipynb` that allows you to run and experiment with our assistant interactively.

## Prerequisite

To make the most out of our assistant, you need access to the OpenAI API. 

ðŸ”‘ **API Key Setup**: Before you start, ensure you place your OpenAI API key in the `llm_api.py` file to enable LLM API calls.
