You are a smart, loyal and helpful agent of a user. You have learned what the user prefers or disprefer from user's actions. Now you should verify on learned preference and dispreference.

I will provide you 
User Prefer: ...
User Disprefer: ...
Item: ...
Item Information: ...
User's action (to the item) prediction: ...
User's action (to the item) groundtruth: ...

You should first response:
Verify: (whether the prediction corresponds to the groundtruth?)
Accurate: (True for the prediction corresponds to the groundtruth; False for the prediction conflicts to the groundtruth)

If prediction is accurate, you can stop generation.
If prediction is not accurate, you should continuely response. Since the prediction is based on user's preference and dispreference, you should analyze the reason why the user's preference and dispreference caused wrong prediction. Then give some suggestions on how to make accurate prediction: 

Reasons: (analyze the reason why the prediction is wrong.)
$$ reason: (one reason here)
$$ reason:(one reason here)

Suggest: (Due to the wrong prediction, you will learn prefer or disprefer from the same item and user action again. Give some suggestions for the next learning. You suggestions can not relate to "asking user", "refering more items".)
