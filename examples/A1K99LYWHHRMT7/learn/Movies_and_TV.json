With Krista Star (Jill Wagner) by his side, they fight to keep the world safe from the denizens of the dark who seek to destroy the human race.', 'Picking up where the final theatrical feature (<i>Blade: Trinity</i>) left off, <i>Blade: The Series</i> made a valiant attempt to translate the Marvel Comics vampire hunter\\'s adventures to the small screen; though the series was short-lived, the DVD features uncut versions of the episodes, as well as a smattering of extras. Rapper-turned-actor Kirk \"Sticky Fingaz\" Jones takes up the katana from Wesley Snipes as Blade, and he certainly fills the physical requirements for the role, which requires him to hunt down the well-bred bloodsuckers in the House of Chthon, whose leader, Marcus Van Sciver (Neil Jackson), is developing a serum that will cure vampires of their weaknesses (sunlight, garlic, sunlight). Aiding Blade in his campaign is former Army vet and vampire-in-training Krista (Jill Wagner), who lost a brother to the House of Chthon and her humanity to Van Sciver; in between bouts of swordplay and martial arts with the House\\'s followers, we also delve into Blade\\'s back story, which covers his early days as a vampire. All 13 episodes of <i>Blade: The Series</i> (including the two-part pilot, which was previously released on DVD as <i>Blade: House of Chthon</i>) are energetic and action-heavy (and hew closely to its comic origins--<i>Blade</i> villains like Damek and Marvel characters like Moon Knight are referenced), though the leaden dialogue is a frequent stumbling point; ultimately, the series\\' approach (which was more crime story than vampire action) didn\\'t have the same appeal as the big-budget, effects-heavy features. Loyal fans, however, won\\'t be disappointed by the decision to present the uncut versions of all but one (\"Monsters\") of the episodes in this set, which feature a great deal of gruesome violence and sexuality that was trimmed for the original network run. However, the extras, which include a seven-part behind-the-scenes featurette and commentary tracks for the pilot episode (one by director Peter O\\'Fallon and one by writer and executive producer David Goyer and Geoff Jones) were both included on the <i>House of Chthon</i> DVD release. <i>--Paul Gaita</i>']",

        "description": "['The follow-up to the popular <I>Gundam Seed</I> (2002), <I>Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny</I> (2004) takes place two years later, in year 73 of the Cosmic Era. Hot-headed Shin Asuka, whose family was killed during the previous war, becomes the pilot of the Impulse, the latest and most complex Gundam, which assembles itself in midair. Athrun Zala, the hero of <I>Gundam Seed</I>, has given up combat duty, but by the end of Episode #5, he\\'s back where he belongs: in the cockpit of the aptly named Gundam Savior. The conflict between the Naturals and the genetically enhanced Coordinators remains the underlying cause of the political conflicts. Renegade Coordinators disturb the orbit of the asteroid Junius 7, positioning it to strike the Earth. Shin, Athrun and other Mobile Suit pilots destroy as much of Junius as they can, saving the world from complete destruction. But the enormous devastation precipitates a declaration of war from the Earth Alliance against ZAFT and the satellite worlds of the PLANTs. Characters and <I>mecha</I> from <I>Gundam Seed</I> join the new cast in a complicated series of political and military maneuvers, highlighted by the rip-roaring Mobile Suit battles. Director Mitsuo Fukuda skillfully blends CG and traditional animation to give the fights in space, under water, and on land their maximum pizzazz. The endless flashbacks and the clips from <I>Gundam Seed</I> occupy so much time that when Shin and the ZAFT forces find the secret biological lab where children were mutated into the cyborg pilots Sting, Auel, and Stella, it feels like an afterthought, rather than the climax of the first half of the story. <I>Gundam Seed Destiny</I> reflects contemporary political issue more clearly than any other entry in the long-running <I>Gundam</I> continuity. The revolt of the indigenous people of Western Eurasia against the Earth Alliance Forces; the mounting chorus to purge Coordinators from \"our pure and blue world;\" and ZAFT Chairman Durandal\\'s lengthy denunciation of defense contractors who foment wars to increase profits have a disquietingly familiar ring.

Aligning yourself with someone with the potential to become one of the most powerful warlords in any of Japan's possible histories might not be a bad start. Provided, of course, that you can keep yourself from becoming too intimately involved in the cloak and dagger action during a time when the cloaks cover body armor and the daggers are paired with multiple swords!

Unfortunately for him, the gift seems to have skipped a generation. Defeated by his younger, female cousin, Ayano, in a battle to become the clan&rsquo;s successor, Kazuma is exiled with only the smoldering burn of failure to keep him company. But now he&rsquo;s back, risen from the ashes and armed with a powerful new mojo that&rsquo;s sure to fan the flames of the family rivalry. The cooler he gets &ndash; the hotter she burns, and when Wind and Fire collide, Tokyo is caught in the eye of the storm.', \"Kazuma, the hero of the fantasy-adventure <I>Kaze no Stigma</I> (2007), was disowned by the Kannagi clan for failing to master Fire Magic, the traditional source of their power. In the intervening years, he's become an exceptionally powerful user of Wind Magic, while the future of the Kannagi clan has been vested in his loudmouth cousin Ayano. As reluctant allies, Kazuma and Ayano tackle various supernatural foes, ranging from evil deities to mischievous pixies. Unfortunately, neither Kazuma nor Ayano are particularly likable: he's a sarcastic, mercenary jerk; she yells and fusses, but relies on Kazuma to rescue her--and take her to dinner. The filmmakers can't decide if they're making a comedy, a romance, or an adventure. Fan-service panty shots interrupt potentially fatal conflicts; adventures end before they really begin; and if Kazuma and Ayano end up together, it's probably because no else would want either one of them. Pretty much every element in <I>Kaze no Stigma</I> has been used in other series, and usually more skillfully.

Haunted by the vicious slaying of his parents, Tetsu joins a group of elite swordsmen to hunt down the rebels who murdered his parents.', 'Set during the troubled times between the arrival of Admiral Perry in 1853 and the Meiji Restoration of 1868, <I>Peacemaker</I> (2003) often feels like a prequel to <I>Rurouni Kenshin</I>, but from the politically opposite side. Tetsunosuke \"Tetsu\" Ichimura initially seems like an anime stereotype: the irrepressible half-pint who wins out through sheer determination. At 15, Tetsu is stubborn and impetuous, but he\\'s wrestling with personal demons. When his older brother Tatsu becomes a bookkeeper for the <I>Shinsengumi</I>, a group of samurai the Shogun organized to protect the capital, Tetsu decides to join the quasi-military corps. His resolute spirit charms fey swordsman Souji Okita, who coaxes iron-willed vice-commander Hijikata into accepting the boy as a page. Tetsu becomes the unofficial mascot of the goofy but deadly <I>ronin</I> of the <I>Shinsengumi</I>: they call him \"Puppy Boy,\" tease him about being cute, and even speculate that Hijitaka keeps him around for sexual favors. As the series progresses and the conflict with the anti-Shogun forces nears, Tetsu must decide whether to avenge his parents, who were murdered by Imperialist agents, or become a \"Peacemaker,\" as his father desired. The spectacularly choreographed battle scenes show just how grueling a trial Tetsu faces.', \"Many of the characters and incidents in <I>Peacemaker</I> are based in fact, although the filmmakers take considerable liberties and the story rambles. But it's the interaction of the characters that gives the series its appeal: Even the minor samurai feel like credible individuals. Writer Hiroshi Yamaguchi and director Tomohiro Hirata refuse to offer facile solutions to Tetsu's inner conflict, which gives <I>Peacemaker</I> a satisfying depth. The boxed set lacks the many extras--both on video and in print--that were included with the individual discs.

        "description": "[\"Epic Action Drama. Set in Japan during the 1870s, The Last Samurai tells the story of Capt. Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), a respected American military officer hired by the Emperor of Japan to train the country's first army in the art of modern warfare. As the Emperor attempts to eradicate the ancient Imperial Samurai warriors in preparation for more Westernized and trade-friendly government policies, Algren finds himself unexpectedly impressed and influenced by his encounters with the Samurai, which places him at the center of a struggle between two eras and two worlds, with only his own sense of honor to guide him.\", 'No actor works harder to open a movie than Tom Cruise. His enthusiasm is throughout the DVD extras as he mirrors his samurai character by constantly talking about \"loyalty\" and \"discipline\" while working on the film. However as a post-movie experience, the top-line extras with Cruise and director Edward Zwick are repetitive and underwhelming, with too many clips from the film we assume DVD viewers have just seen. The History Channel show is also a pre-release promotional device that misses an opportunity to really dig into this intriguing time period. Better are segments on the costumes, the production design, and how you put together an Imperial army--in New Zealand, no less. Zwick\\'s low-key and dense commentary (plus a \"Video Journal\") is not vital, but he illustrates many of the little peculiarities it took to make the wide-ranging film come together. There are two deleted scenes; a samurai\\'s first appearance is particularly memorable. <I>--Doug Thomas</I>']",
