As they learn to control their abilities and use them to their advantage; their lives start to spin out of control; and their darker sides begin to take over.', 'If you should come upon a glowing, possibly extraterrestrial object buried in a hole, go ahead and touch the thing--you might just get superpowers. Or so it goes for the three high-school buds in <i>Chronicle</i>, an inventive excursion into the teenage sci-fi world. Once affected by the power, the guys exercise the joys of telekinesis: shuffling cars around in parking lots, moving objects in grocery stores, that kind of thing. Oh yeah--they can fly, too: and here director Josh Trank takes wing, in the movie\\'s giddiest sequence, as the trio zips around the clouds in a glorious wish-fulfillment. It goes without saying that there will be a shadow side to this gift, and that\\'s where <i>Chronicle</i>, for all its early cleverness, begins to stumble. Broody misfit Andrew (Dane DeHaan), destined to be voted Least Likely to Handle Superpowers Well by his graduating class, is documenting all this with his video camera, which is driving him even crazier (the movie\\'s in \"found footage\" style, so everything we see is from a camcorder or security camera, an approach that gets trippy when Andrew realizes he can levitate his camera without having to hold it). Trank and screenwriter Max Landis (son of John) seem to lose inspiration when the last act rolls around, so the movie settles for weightless battles around the Space Needle and a smattering of mass destruction. Still, let\\'s give <i>Chronicle</i> credit for an offbeat angle, and a handful of memorable scenes. <i>--Robert Horton</i>']",

        "description": "[\"He trusts nothing but his own sword. He has no place to call home. The lone mercenary Guts travels a land ravaged by a hundred-year war. Moving from battlefield to battlefield, his skill and ferocity eventually attract the attention of Griffith, the leader of a group of mercenaries called The Band of the Hawk. Desiring Guts's power to help him achieve his goals, Griffith succeeds in recruiting the distrustful Guts by challenging him to a duel and defeating him. <br /><br />As the Band of the Hawk fight together and their bond as a unit grows stronger, Griffith and Guts's bond deepens as well. With their continued success on the battlefield, Griffith achieves the first step toward his lofty goals: his band of mercenaries becomes recognized as a full-fledged army within the Midland Kingdom. Despite all their success, Guts begins to question his reasons for fighting for Griffith's dream, which, unbeknownst to Guts, is destined to bestow a monstrous fate on them both.\", \"<i>Berserk: The Golden Age, Arc I--The Egg of the King</i> was released in Japan in early 2012, at the same time as <i>Berserk: The Golden Age, Arc II--The Battle for Doldrey</i>, with a third film slated for early 2013. Based on a popular manga by Kentaro Miura, <i>Berserk</i> follows the career of Guts, a taciturn mercenary who fights with a huge, two-handed broadsword. When he's defeated in hand-to-hand combat by the effete but deadly Griffith, Guts joins his elite mercenary corps, the Band of the Hawk. Griffith aspires to a kingdom of his own at the very least, and uses the skills of his fiercely loyal Hawks to gain status by aiding the Kingdom of Midland in its protracted war with Chuder. Part of Griffith's power seems linked to an odd, red gem he wears around his neck: the Egg of the King. Like the broadcast series of <i>Berserk</i> (1997), director Toshiyuki Kubooka's feature presents a dark, violent vision of medieval warfare that is grittier and gorier than most chivalric anime adventures. The filmmakers combine drawn and computer animation for large-scale battle scenes that borrow from the Siege of Gondor in the <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. But <i>Golden Age, Arc I</i> feels more like a succession of set pieces than a coherent narrative, beginning with Guts' initial duel with Bazuso, an ax-wielding giant who resembles a <i>mecha</i> version of the Michelin Tire Man. The relatively brief (77-minute) running time doesn't allow for much character development beyond indicating that Guts is haunted by internal and external demons. <i>Golden Age, Arc I</i> was clearly meant to be seen in conjunction with the second film, as the story simply stops with no real conclusion. Those caveats aside, this new version of <i>Berserk</i> represents the state of the art for violent, big-budget anime.

But in order to become Griffith's equal and truly be called his friend, Guts realizes he will have to leave the Band of the Hawk. At the same time, a bloody battle to capture the impenetrable Fortress of Doldrey from the Empire of Chuder is about to begin. The Band of the Hawk will face an army 30,000 strong!\", \"<i>Berserk: The Golden Age Arc II--The Battle for Doldrey</i> (2012) continues the three-part retelling of Kentaro Miura's manga that began with <i>Berserk: The Golden Age Arc I--The Egg of the King</i>. During a battle with an invading force from Chuder, Guts and Caska are separated from the rest of the Hawks. Guts saves Caska's life but receives little thanks for his trouble. While hiding in enemy territory, Caska describes how Griffith earned her loyalty by saving her from a rapist. The Hawks arrive just in time to rescue Caska from Chuder soldiers--and find Guts surrounded by the bodies of 100 foes he's just dispatched. The strategic Castle of Doldrey is the key to the century-long war between Midland and Chuder; Griffith and the Hawks seize it, despite its impregnable position and huge defensive force that includes the Holy Purple Rhino Knights. As he did in <i>Egg of the King</i>, director Toshiyuki Kubooka combines drawn and computer animation in large-scale battle sequences that borrow heavily from the Siege of Gondor in <i>The Return of the King</i>. But Kubooka pushes the gore to inadvertently comic excesses as arms, heads, weapons, and gobbets of blood fly across the screen. After the victory, Guts leaves the White Hawks as he no longer wishes to be the tool of another's ambition. The shattered Griffith seduces Princess Charlotte of Midland. Furious, the King tortures him and decimates the Hawks, leaving the plot to be resolved in the third film, slated for release in 2013. Although the manga of <i>Berserk</i> was praised for the depth of its characterizations, there's not much depth to the animated characters: the monosyllabic Guts remains little more than a brooding cipher at the center of the action. The graphic violence and sexual content in <i>The Battle for Doldrey</i> is not for the squeamish.
