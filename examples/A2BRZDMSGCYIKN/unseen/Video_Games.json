        "reviewText": "LoS 2 was just a mediocre entry into the Castlevania franchise.  I personally thought the first game was much better.  LoS 2 suffered from a few major drawbacks:  first, the storyline.  It was really choppy, sorry to say.  Some things just didn't make sense and left you wondering why the writers crafted such a plot line.  Another thing is the combat....during fights, I did not like how Dracula responded when he got attacked.  In the vast majority of defensive combat cases, you're not given enough reaction time to avoid a second hit.  As a result, Dracula would be forced to get hit twice.\n\nThe bosses are another issue.  They looked pretty good, but they all seemed way too basic.  Not enough titan-type bosses either.  If you like a mindless hack-n-slash game without brain-teaser puzzles, this is your game.  The conclusion of the game was rather weak too.  Throughout the whole game, Dracula kept commenting about how he wished he would die for good.  We don't get that in this game, and that would have been the appropriate ending.\n\nAs for the trophies and DLC, I didn't bother collecting everything to get all the trophies.  It's a complete waste of time.  The game is very long, and it's relatively easy to get lost trying to go back to places you've already been to.  Because I found the game to be mediocre at best, I had no interest in purchasing the DLC (Alucard side story).  At $8, the DLC is overpriced as it is.\n\nThat's it.  If you played the first LoS, get this game to complete your collection.  I wouldn't play the game again though.",

        "overall": 3,
        "reviewText": "Batman: Arkham Knight really doesn't improve on much of anything if you're familiar with the Arkham series.  Sure, the graphics are \"improved\" (if you can really call it that) on the PS4.  I just got my PS4 last week, and it's tough to really see any sizeable difference between my PS3 Arkham games and this one.  The Batmobile is a nice inclusion, but I think it was poorly conceived.  The controls are a little wonky, and the physics engine for that segment of the game has gotta be cheaply built or designed.  It just doesn't feel right to me, and that feeling is reflected in how I command the car to move within the game.  Something is just \"off\".  I can't quite put my finger on it.\n\nI actually enjoyed Arkham Origins a helluva lot more than this game, to be dead honest.  AO had a decent premise with actual boss battles (hint:  Arkham Knight doesn't have any actual villain boss battles in it!!!  Big deduction right there).  A few elements from AO were also incorporated into this game (Riddler henchmen interrogations, cryptographic sequencer segments, etc.).  Overall, the gameplay mechanics of Arkham Knight are not significantly different from the rest of the games in this series.\n\nAs far as the story itself goes, like I said..Arkham Origins and the previous titles had a better story.  I'm very glad that The Joker still continues to play a major role in this game, even though he got killed off in Arkham City.  But Scarecrow?  I never liked that character.  It's more believable for someone to dress up like a deranged clown and start psychotically murdering people than for someone to concoct a fear toxin and massively dispense it on a city-wide scale.\n\nOne final note (and this is worthy of a full star deduction, hence the title of my review):  WHERE IS ALFRED?  I mean, how come you don't actually meet him within the game?  He's your butler, for god's sake!  Someone who has been by your side since you were a little kid.  You would think that we could actually see Alfred within the game instead of on your arm video thing.  And to go with that, WHERE IS THE BATCAVE???  The PS4 is a more advanced system than the PS3...you would think that the developers could have incorporated the Batcave in here somewhere with all the space they have to work with.  At least Arkham Origins had the d*mn Batcave.  It's ridiculous.\n\nNo Alfred?  No Batcave?  No star for you!",

        "reviewText": "I absolutely loathe RPGs, JRPGs, and any video game with the letters \"R-P-G\" describing it.  \"Tales of Symphonia\" is no exception.  You know, I tried getting into this genre.  First, I began with Final Fantasy for the original NES.  It was ok, at best.  Then, fast forward about 15 years and then I played Final Fantasy X.  That game did me in.  Hated it with a passion.  Now....Tales of Symphonia.  WHY I decided to see if RPGs would resonate with me is beyond me.  Clearly, I wasn't meant to play this genre.\n\nIn ToS, I got up to the first major boss fight (Botta) and couldn't beat him.  Threw in the towel right then and there, and sold the game within a couple hours.  I just had to get it out of my sight completely.  Gameplay like this is downright awful.  Apparently, RPGs/JRPGs are for very patient gamers who loveeee doing the same thing over, and over, and over again (i.e. grind to build up EXP, etc.).  I am not that type of gamer....at all.  I don't want to grind my way to the best skills, I don't want to go through the agony of having to pick and choose among hundreds of different types of spells/swords/charms/etc just to have the best combo to beat ONE boss, and I certainly don't want to play through a game 95% of the way and never finish because of an insanely hard boss battle that you can never beat because you failed to do something early on.  Screw that.\n\nThis was the very last RPG game I'll ever buy and play.  Done.  If I see the developers of this game on the street, I'll be sure to slaughter them in cold blood.  Speaking of that, time for Mortal Kombat....",

        "overall": 4,
        "reviewText": "The best way to describe this game is it's a combination of the open-world gameplay of Assassin's Creed and the combat of the Batman Arkham series.  It's truly a never-ending type of game because you can just play it to slaughter orcs, which is great if you've had a bad day.  I had to take off one star for three reasons:\n\n1)  There's too much needless collecting.  Completing the main storyline only gives you 50% of total game completion.  In order to get 100%, you need to collect all the artifacts and Ithildin, as well as complete all the hunting and survival challenges, weapons missions, and other side missions.  All of that is completely optional, and I didn't bother doing them all.  Really, all that stuff is for trophy nuts who are addicted to getting trophies.  I wish they made it mandatory to complete most of those side missions and/or get those collectibles in order to advance the main storyline, but you can easily complete the game without even doing one of the aforementioned tasks.\n\n2)  I should have bought the original, non-GOTY game.  The DLC is pretty useless.  Specifically, The Bright Lord campaign is WAY too difficult after the first two or three missions.  I don't know why they upped the difficulty so much.  Doesn't make sense to me, so I just filed my game into my CD case and called it a day.  As far as I'm concerned, once I beat the main crux or storyline of a game, that's it for me.  All DLC is just a cash cow for developers.\n\nand,\n\n3)  The game gets repetitive after a while.  Unless you enjoy slaughtering orcs if you've had a bad day or week, expect to not play this game again once you've already beaten it.\n\n4 stars.",

As great a collection as it is, this game should never be a part of the Metal Gear canon.  The overall level design strategy is god-AWFUL.  I didn't find the gameplay too challenging, but I threw in the towel when I had to fight the tank in the desert.\n\nApparently, the only weapon that can destroy the tank are mines.  I had 10 mines on me, and they weren't enough to take it down.  You REALLY think I'm going to go back through allllll those rooms and look for a supply of mines??  You gotta be kidding me!  They could at least have some mines to raid out of a truck at least 2 or 3 screens away!  But nooo....  The best part is that mines are the ONLY weapon that could do damage to the tank.  Grenade launcher?  Nope.  Remote-controlled rockets?  NOPE....not even those damage the tank.\n\nYou would think that the people who developed this game could reasonably assume that other heavy-duty weapons other than mines would damage a tank.

This game is great...awesome story (very believable, too), great cutscenes (terrible graphics, but that's how it was for the time), and ok combat.  I had to take off one star for the following reasons:\n\n1)  The combat.  It's just ok...sometimes the controls stick and it's tough to get up from a crawl and Snake sometimes backs up against walls you didn't mean him to back up onto.  The aiming can take a bit to get used to as well.\n\n2)  You will die....A LOT....the game is not very easy on the \"easy\" setting either.

I vigorously researched everything possible about how to beat it, and so many people had difficulty with it.

During combat players are able to target specific areas of an enemy\\'s body and performance during each mission is ranked according to elapsed time, number of kills and other criteria. <p/> <b>4-player Co-op Multiplayer</b><br/> Along with a deep single player mode <i>Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker</i> contains exceptional multiplayer co-op functionality. Co-op action is facilitated via the PSP\\'s local wireless ad-hoc connection and features different types of missions. Missions more dependent on stealth are limited to two-player games, while others--for example, boss battles--are meant for games of up to four players. Players have their choice of different versions of Snake. These not only possess differing appearance, but more importantly, differing strengths. During co-op play players can pull resources by staying within a minimal distance from each other This link is indicated by circles emanating around them. While maintaining this connection resources can be shared, including weapons, supplies and and overall health, indicated by a shared health bar. Players are able to view partner\\'s inventory at a touch of the PSP\\'s left or right face buttons, and when need be can resuscitate a fallen companion. When linked players can also move in unison by virtually tapping your partner\\'s shoulder with a touch of the D-pad and then making your move. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><b>The Latest Title in the <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> Series</b> - A true continuation of the ever-evolving franchise that stood the test of time and started the stealth action genre, <i>Peace Walker</i> is the first title on the PSP system in which mastermind Hideo Kojima has fully taken up the reigns to direct, write, and design the game himself.</li> <li><b>Extensive Content</b> - Arguably one of the deepest PSP games to be released as Kojima Productions pushes the boundaries of the platform to new levels while blending various game styles together in ways that will captivate and engross both veterans and newcomers to <i>Metal Gear</i>.</li> <li><b>Proven Gameplay, Story, and More</b> - Fans of the series will enjoy the exhilaration of familiar stealth elements of previous <i>MGS</i> titles and will also be enticed by the new gameplay features making their debut in <i>Peace Walker</i>.

        "reviewText": "Really, a fantastic game.  Ever since Brotherhood, I lost interest in the series.  Black Flag completely rekindled it.\nThe only negative thing I can say about this game is that they still haven't perfected the \"running up the wrong wall\" debacle (this is very, very evident in the pursue/catch the guy missions).\nOther than that, BF has a pretty decent storyline, and there's soooo much collecting (I finished the main game with 63% total completion).  Once I finish the primary storyline, I never return to video games.  To me, collecting stuff is too much of a chore (as I like to say, collecting stuff in a video game is a \"chore for the trophy whore!\"), but for Black Flag, I just might revisit it in the future to sail the seven seas once again.\n\nP.S.  I wonder if Ubisoft ever got sued for their main theme.  It sounds very similar to The Tudors opening credits theme.  (compare them on YouTube and see for yourself)",

Less than 3 hours into the game and I immediately traded it in, and here's why..\n\nI have no problem with hunting a ton of different animals in order to craft items, but when you hunt a ton of animals, then you die, you lose ALL of your animal skins!  ALL OF THEM!  Now why the f*** would I want to play a game where all of my efforts have been wasted???  You gotta be out of your mind!  After dying on the battlefield, whether it's by a pirate or an animal, you should KEEP all of the hides you've hunted!  Instead, you start right back at your last saved checkpoint.  It's absolutely unbelievable, and I can't believe they didn't put any effort into designing an appropriate save feature.\n\nLuckily, I bought this for around $15.  I also have Far Cry 4 for PS4, which I bought for $15 as well.  It's still sitting on my shelf, unwrapped.  Guess what?  I have no interest in playing that game at all.

        "reviewText": "Totally hate this game.  Maybe it's because I'm over 30 and have very little patience for action platformer video games these days?  I don't know, but this game is exceptionally frustrating, to say the very least.  And I grew up on the old Nintendo, Super Mario platforming days.  This game is nothing like that.  It's extremely difficult, to the point where it does nothing to help my temper issues.  If you want to seriously throw your controller down the block, then get this game.  Otherwise, please do yourselves a favor and pass it up.  You don't need the aggravation in your life.",

This still  is one of the most beautiful, fun, and imaginative side-scrolling  platform jumping games ever released.\", \"You control the now-famous Rayman, a strange character with no arms or  legs (although he has feet and hands) and a propeller on his head.

The difficulty level is  just right at the beginning, letting players get a feel for Rayman's  basic moves. Later levels require more advanced tricks and precise  jumps, but the game is never unfair--something few 2-D side-scrolling  games can claim.

        "reviewText": "Not a bad horror-adventure title...decent story line.  Plays like Heavy Rain, so if you liked that game, you'll probably love this one.  I had to deduct one star for 2 reasons:\n\n1.  There's no way to replay an episode until AFTER you beat the game, so if you make a mistake or miss something, you can't just stop the game and replay it from the last checkpoint.  This is a real drawback, and it forces you to play the whole episode over again from the beginning (once you beat the game).  I missed a few trophies due to this fact, too.\n\n2.  A minor point, but it needs to be said:  the \"Don't Move!\" control segments of the game are SUPER sensitive.  For a few of those segments, I never moved the controller and it STILL registered as moved.  This inadvertently altered the outcome of the game and also caused me to miss trophies.\n\nDon't get me wrong...the game is worthy of at least three full playthroughs, but I just wish you weren't forced to do so in order to correct any mistakes you made.  You should be able to replay the episodes after you complete each one, not until you beat the game.",

Ps4 and Xbox can't compare to the amount of lives lost alone in this very game. For one thing, the cat suit is AWFUL.  When you jump on a wall, why does he start sliding down??  Every time you jump back on the wall, you should always start climbing up!  Very poor game mechanic and the worst suit ever created for Mario.\n\nAnother thing...the camera angles!!!  Worst camera angles in a Mario game ever. When you think you're making a good jump, to your death you go!  REALLY couldn't stand that. After beating the game and getting to the secret worlds, forget it. You'll throw the gamepad at the screen like I did. Oh, and don't even BOTHER trying to collect every stamp and green star in the game. Very impossible...unless you want to die young. Do yourselves a favor and stay AWAY from this game!  I'll stick with the classic Mario games I was brought up on.",

For the first time ever, Nintendo has created a four-player Mario game set in a 3D world. The game, developed by the same team that created Super Mario 3D Land for Nintendo 3DS and the Super Mario Galaxy games for Wii, lets up to four players play as Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach and Toad. Each character has his or her own unique characteristics, and people can play cooperatively or competitively. The new cat transformation turns characters into adorable felines that can scratch enemies and even scamper up the flagpole at the end of levels. Clear warp pipes add some new puzzle elements to game play.']",

Now 20 years later, I am STILL repulsed by it.  It's exceptionally frustrating.  I have nothing against it being a side-scroller, but trying to attack enemies is ridiculous and very difficult.  You die a LOT in this game, and I don't have any patience for that.  And when you lose all your lives, it's truly game over.  Horrible.  They really should call this game Zelda Souls, after the Dark Souls franchise.  Stay away from this one!",

        "reviewText": "It's a great game up to a point.  I could not complete the game because when you had to roll down in a room, you couldn't bomb a certain section.  A missle block came up, meaning that you had to blow up the block underneath with a missile.  There was absolutely no way for me to go back to the same room from below in order to do that.  As a result, I could not complete the game.  TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE design flaw.  Pass this game up.  It's not worth your time due to the complete incompetence put in when making the levels.",
        "description": "[\"Join Samus Aran and journey through a rich adventure that tells how the entire Metroid saga began. Expanding on the legendary NES Metroid title, experience new upgrades to Samus's suit plus all-new abilities like the Power Grip and Zip Line. Beautiful cut-scenes bring the story to life as the plot thickens beyond your wildest imagination!\", '', \"When people ask me what my favorite game of all time is, I always answer the same thing: <i>Metroid</i>. Sure, <i>Super Metroid</i> on SNES took the concept and made it better, and <i>Metroid Fusion</i> was a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go. Then there's <i>Metroid Prime</i>but that's 3D and a story for a different day. This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.\", \"So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newest <i>Metroid</i> redo appeared on my desk. For those of you that may not know, <i>Zero Mission</i> is a special edition of sorts. It's the original <i>Metroid</i> with spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.\", \"At it's core, it is most definitely the original <i>Metroid</i>, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.\", \"Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (including <i>Metroid Prime</i>).\", 'In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experienced <i>Metroid</i>, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don\\'t let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.<br /><br /><b>Concept:</b><br />Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus material <br /><br /><b>Graphics:</b><br />Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA Player <br /><br /><b>Sound:</b><br />Fantastic from beginning to end <br /><br /><b>Playability:</b><br /><i>Metroid</i>\\'s control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created  brilliant <br /><br /><b>Entertainment:</b><br />Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come true <br /><br /><b>Replay:</b><br />Moderate <br /><br />Rated: <b>9.5 out of 10</b><br />Editor: <b>Andy McNamara</b><br />Issue: <b>February 2004</b><br /><br /><b>2nd Opinion:</b><br /> Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the original <i>Metroid</i> to feature bonus content that ties into Samus\\' continuing adventures. I can\\'t even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let\\'s just say that you\\'re in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don\\'t want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there\\'s a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you\\'ll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you\\'ll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better. Buy it immediately. <br /><br />Rated: <b>9.75 out of 10</b><br />Editor: <b>Andrew Reiner</b><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/\" target=\"\"><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif\" border=\"0\" /></a><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/\">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Game Informer Review</i>']",

The story has a nice twist to it, although one star had to be deducted for clearly copying the gameplay of most of the Telltale Series of games (walking dead, game of thrones, etc.).  But a bigger issue is the fact that it's not worth playing again to see how the story changes because you don't get trophies for exploring different decisions, like in the case of Heavy Rain.\n Other than that, it's worth playing for an interesting story.",
